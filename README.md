## 🌸 About Me

Hi, I’m **Marisa**.

I’m a developer who loves mixing **code, animation, and design**.  
I enjoy building interactive projects, playful UIs, live characters, and systems that feel alive.

I like:
- Frontend engineering
- Animation and motion
- Creative tooling
- Cute aesthetics with real technical depth
- Building things that feel personal and expressive

Yes, there’s kawaii energy.  
Yes, it still ships.
